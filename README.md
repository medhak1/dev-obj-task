# Back-End Developer Challenge
## Introduction
Welcome to the Blockchain at Berkeley objective task for Back-End Developers.

## The Tasks
You are given a number tasks, each worth a varying amount of points corresponding to their respective difficulty. **Your goal is to amass a total of four points to pass the challenge.** This is the point breakdown:

| Task Name          | Point Value   |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| balanced_brackets  | 1             |
| divide             | 1             |
| merkle_tree        | 2             |
| smart_contract     | 3             |

Write solutions in Python 3 such that you pass the provided test cases and any test cases you can come up on your own. Remember, the code you write should provide the correct solution for all cases, not just the provided examples.

**WARNING:** You should be writing custom test cases or evaluating them within the interpreter because there are a lot of cases we will be testing for. We are looking for clean, optimized code, so runtime and space matters, however so does convenience. Strike a reasonable balance and you'll do well.

If you are missing any relevant packages that are imported into the files by default, you can install them using `pip3`.

## Words of Encouragement
This is the hardest part of the interview. We promise that the rest is much more relaxed. If you're a freshman and you can't get some of these questions - that's fine, but you should keep trying until you simply can't solve it.

Upperclassmen, you've probably seen more difficult questions so we hope that these are all possible to answer for the most part. Good luck and ping medha@blockchain.berkeley.edu if you have questions.

## Submission Instructions
*DO NOT FORK THIS REPO,* SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PUBLIC WILL BE DISQUALIFED. We ask that you do not share any solutions and work alone.

Instead, zip up the contents of the root of this repo and submit those using a google form: https://goo.gl/forms/YvI48EcUsyTf9OFZ2. Only submit completed tasks in the zip.

Do not change or rename the folder structure. We will be running autograders on these and if the format fails then we will not accept them as valid solutions.

*The contents of the zip file should be the folders in this repo.*
